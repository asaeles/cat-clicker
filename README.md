# Cat Clicker Premium Pro

Inspired by a famous Facebook trivial game "Cow Clicker" now its time for cats.

The app is an SPA based on the KnockoutJS framwework that displays a list of cat names, clicking the name will show the cat's details, clicking the cat image will increment the click count for the selected cat and advance the age of the cat.

Additionally, pressing the Admin button will show a form where you cna edit the cat details name, URL and click count.

The app uses local storage to save data.

## Requirements

None, just a web browser.

## Usage

* Optional: edit the `cats.json` file to your taste (the file comes with 5 preset cat images)

* Open `app.html` using any web browser

* Select cat name and then press on its image to increment its click counter

## Known Issues

* If cat images are not yet cached by the browser, a delay is noticed in updating the cat image when a selecting different cats.

## Room for improvements

* Add styles to the page

## Contributions

I encourage you all to contribute into this simple project to make better and more usable.
